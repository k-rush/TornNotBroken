<p>I came up with the idea for this company after battling with addiction for the better part of a decade.  At the age of 41 I was completely lost and hopeless. Alcohol and Opiates completely owned me.  My world had become incredibly small.  Countless times I tried to quit on my own only to fail miserably and end up right where I was before.</p>

<p>I'm one of the few lucky addicts that still had a family that hadn't given up on me.  My saving grace was my brother worked with an addict that had been through rehab and sober living.  He gave my family guidance on what I needed to do to get my life back.  I've been sober since October 9th, 2015.</p>

<p>Rehab and sober living are expensive.  A lot of addicts have burned all their bridges and have no way to get the help they need.  My mission is to help as many addicts and alcoholics get the same opportunity that I have been given.  As Torn Not Broken grows we will be adding more products and we will share personal stories os addicts in recovery.</p>

<p>To start, 10% of the profits are set aside to provide scholarships for sober living and gym membership.  My hope as the business grows that we will be ale to donate a higher percentage of the profits.</p>
